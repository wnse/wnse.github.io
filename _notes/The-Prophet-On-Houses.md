[[Kahlil Gibran]] [[卡里·纪伯伦]]
译者：冰心/李家真

On Houses

Then a mason came forth and said, Speak to us of Houses.

听闻此言，一名石工上前说道，请给我们讲讲居室。

And he answered and said:

于是他答道：

Build of your imaginings a bower in the wildernness ere you build a house within the city walls.

在城里建造居室之前，先要用你的想象，在原野之中搭一座窝棚。

For evenn as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in you, the ever distant and alone.

因为你内心的那个漂泊者，那个永远疏离的孤独魂灵，也需在薄暮之时归家，一如你自己的情形。

Your house is your larger body.

你的居室，是你尺寸较大的躯体。

It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless. Does not your house dream? And dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop?

它在阳光之下生长，在夜晚的静谧之中安寝；它，并不是没有梦。你的居室岂不有梦？岂不在梦中憧憬，离开城市，前往林间山顶？

Would that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow.

我愿将你们的居室拢入掌心，再像播种的人一般，将它们撒播在草地和森林。

Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments.

愿山谷成为你们的街衢，愿葱绿的蹊径成为你们的巷陌，愿你们在果园之中彼此觅寻，衣上染满大地的芳馨。

But these things are not yet to be.

只可惜，这一切暂时不会来临。

In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear shall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separarte your hearths from your fields.

受了恐惧的驱使，你们的先辈将你们拢得太近。这样的恐惧，还会绵延少顷。少顷之间，你们的城垣，还会令你们的炉灶和你们的原野，隔绝离分。
