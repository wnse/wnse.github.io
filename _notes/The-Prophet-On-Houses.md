On Houses

Then a mason came forth and said, Speak to us of Houses.

听闻此言，一名石工上前说道，请给我们讲讲居室。

And he answered and said:

于是他答道：

Build of your imaginings a bower in the wildernness ere you build a house within the city walls.

在城里建造居室之前，先要用你的想象，在原野之中搭一座窝棚。

For evenn as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in you, the ever distant and alone.

因为你内心的那个漂泊者，那个永远疏离的孤独魂灵，也需在薄暮之时归家，一如你自己的情形。

Your house is your larger body.

你的居室，是你尺寸较大的躯体。

It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless. Does not your house dream? And dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop?

它在阳光之下生长，在夜晚的静谧之中安寝；它，并不是没有梦。你的居室岂不有梦？岂不在梦中憧憬，离开城市，前往林间山顶？

Would that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow.

我愿将你们的居室拢入掌心，再像播种的人一般，将它们撒播在草地和森林。

Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments.

愿山谷成为你们的街衢，愿葱绿的蹊径成为你们的巷陌，愿你们在果园之中彼此觅寻，衣上染满大地的芳馨。

But these things are not yet to be.

只可惜，这一切暂时不会来临。

In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear shall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separarte your hearths from your fields.

受了恐惧的驱使，你们的先辈将你们拢得太近。这样的恐惧，还会绵延少顷。少顷之间，你们的城垣，还会令你们的炉灶和你们的原野，隔绝离分。

And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses? And what is it you guard with fastened doors?

告诉我，奥法里斯的居民，你们的居室之中，收藏着什么东西？你们紧锁房门，守的是什么物事？

Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?

你们可有安宁，可有这种昭示你们力量的平静追求？

Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind?

你们可有忆念，可有这些连接心灵之巅的闪烁拱桥？

Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashionend of wood and stone to the holy mountain?

你们可有美，可有这种把心灵从木石物件引向圣山的东西？

Tell me, have you these in your houses?

告诉我，你们的居室之中，可有这些物事？

Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master?

难道说，你们有的只是舒适，只是希求舒适的贪欲，难道说，你们有的只是这种鬼鬼祟祟的东西，它去你们的居室做客，随之反客为主，最后竟然成了主子？

Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.

唉，它竟然化身为驯兽师，使用诱饵和鞭子，将你们更大的欲求变成傀儡。

Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.

它的手柔软如丝，它的心却硬如铁石。

It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh.

它哄你们入眠，为的只是站在你们的床边，揶揄血肉之躯的尊严。

It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.

它作弄你们的理智，将你们的理智包裹在蓟绒里，如同包裹易碎的容器。

Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.

千真万确，希求舒适的贪欲会杀害灵魂的激情，然后又走在送葬的队伍之中，大笑不停。

But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed.

可是你们，穹苍之子，不安闲适的你们，绝不可踏入陷阱，也不可俯首称臣。

Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast.

你们的居室不可充作锚链，须当用作桅杆。

It shall not be a glistening film that covers a wound, but an eyelid that guards the eye.

它不该成为遮盖伤创的晶亮薄膜，只该是护卫双眸的眼睑。

You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack and fall down.

你们不可敛翼以求通过房门，不可低头以免撞到房顶，也不可屏息以防屋墙崩坍。

You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.

你们不可，栖居在死者为生者建造的坟圹。

And through of magnificence and splendour, your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing.

即令富丽堂皇，你们的居室也不该隐藏你们的秘密，不该遮蔽你们的渴望。

For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose door is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and the silences of night.

因为你们的无垠内在，栖居在苍穹的殿堂，殿堂以晨雾为门，以夜晚的歌曲和静默为窗。
