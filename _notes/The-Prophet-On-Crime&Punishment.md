On Crime&Punishment

论罪与罚

The one of the judges of the city stood forth and said, Speak to us of Crime and Punishment.

于是本城的法官中，有一个走上前来说：请给我们谈罪与罚。

听闻此言，本城的一名法官上前说道，请给我们讲讲罪与罚。

And he answered, saying:

他回答说：

于是他答道：

It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind,

当你的灵性随风飘荡的时候，

当你们的灵性随风漂泊，撇下主人，

That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.

你孤零而失慎地对别人也就是对自己犯了过错。

孤单无备的你们，才会行不义于他人，由此行不义于自身。

And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.

为着所犯的过错，你必须去叩那受福者之门，要被怠慢地等待片刻。

既然行下此等不义，你们只能叩响蒙福者的大门，无人理睬地等候少顷。

Like the ocean is your god-self;

你们的神性像海洋；

你们的神性如同大洋；

It remains for ever undefiled.

他永远纯洁不染。

不可染污，永远纯净。

And like the ether it lifts but the winged.

又像“以太”，他只帮助有翼者上升。

它如同穹苍，只容有翼者飞升。

Even like the sun is your god-self;

你们的神性也像太阳；

你们的神性正如太阳，

It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.

他不知道田鼠的径路，也不寻找蛇虺的洞穴。

不懂得鼹鼠的伎俩，也不将蛇穴寻访。

But your god-self dwells not alone in your being.

但是你们的神性，不是独居在你们里面。

然而，你们的内心并非只有神性。

Much in you is still man, and much in you is not ye man,

在你们里面，有些仍是“人性”，有些还不成“人性”，

你们内心的许多部分，依然是仅具人性，还有许多部分，尚未具备人性，

But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening.

他只是一个未成形的侏儒，睡梦中在烟雾里蹒跚，自求觉醒。

仅仅是不成形状的侏儒，在迷雾之中梦游，寻求自身的觉醒。

And of the man in you would I now speak.

For it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that knows crime and the punishment of crime.

Oftentimes have I heared you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world.

But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you,

So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.

And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree,

So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.

Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self.

You are the way and the wayfarers.

And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone.

Ay, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.

And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:

The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,

And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.

The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,

And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.

Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,

And still more often the condemned is the burden-bearer for the guiltless and unblamed.

You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked;

For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together.

And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also.

If any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife,

Let him also weight the heart of her husband in scales, and measure his soul with measurements.

And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended.

And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the ax unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;

And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth.

And you judges who would be just,

What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit?

What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?

And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an oppressor,

Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged?

And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds?

Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve?

Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty.

Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon themselves.

And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light?

Only then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self and the day of his god-self,

And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.
