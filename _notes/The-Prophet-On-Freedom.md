[[Kahlil Gibran]] [[卡里·纪伯伦]]
译者：冰心/李家真

On Freedom

And an orator said, Speak to us of Freedom.

And he answered:

At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom, 

Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.
