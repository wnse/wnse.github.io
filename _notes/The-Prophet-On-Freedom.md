On Freedom

论自由

And an orator said, Speak to us of Freedom.

于是一个辩士说：请给我们谈自由。

听闻此言，一名辩士开口说道，请给我们讲讲自由。

And he answered:

他回答说：

于是他答道：

At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom, 

在城门边，在炉火光前，我曾看见你们俯伏敬拜自己的自由，

我曾见你们，在城门口和火炉边俯伏，膜拜自己的自由，

Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.

甚至于像那些囚奴，在诛戮他们的暴君之前卑屈、颂赞。

正如奴隶屈膝赞颂暴君，尽管暴君，将他们屠戮不留。

Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.

噫，在寺院的林中，在城堡的影里，我曾看见你们之中最自由者，把自由像枷铐似的戴上。

唉，我曾见你们当中最自由的人，在神庙的树林里，在城寨的阴影中，将自己的自由穿戴在身，如同披枷带锁的狱囚。

And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment.


You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nghts without a want and a grief,

But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.

And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?

In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle the eyes.

And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?

If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.

You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though your pour the sea upon them.

And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.

For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride?

And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.

And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.

Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.

These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.

And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.

And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.
