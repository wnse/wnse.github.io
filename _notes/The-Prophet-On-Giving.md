On Giving

论施与

Then said a rich man, Speak to us of Giving.

听闻此言，一名富人开口说道，请给我们讲讲施与。

And he answered:

于是他答道：

You give but little when you give of your possessions. 

施舍财产，所施不值一提。

It is when you give of yourself that you truly give. 

施舍自身，方是真正布施。

For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?

要知道，财产无非是你密藏谨守的东西，无非出于你对明日匮乏的忧惧，舍此之外更为何物？

And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?

然则明日，明日又能将什么带给过虑的狗儿，既然它追随朝圣者前往圣城，但却将骨头埋在沿途，埋进不留痕迹的沙土？

And what is fear of need but need itself? 

匮乏之忧，岂不正是匮乏本身？

Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?

井满之时的焦渴之忧，岂不正是无法解除的焦渴？

There are those who give little of the much which they have - and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.

有些人所有甚多，所施者甚少。他们的施与只为荣耀，暗藏的欲求，令他们的礼物无复美好。

And there are those who have little and give it all.

有些人所有甚少，但却倾囊施与。

These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.

这些人相信生命，相信生命的丰盈，他们的嚢橐永不空虚。

There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.

有些人怀着喜悦施与，喜悦便是他们的奖励。

And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.

有些人怀着痛苦施与，痛苦便是他们的洗礼。

And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;

有些人慨然施与，不觉痛苦，不求喜悦，亦不存为善之念。

They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.

他们慨然施与，如同远方山谷里的香桃木，顾自将芬芳洒满天地。

Though the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.

便是借这些人的手，真神宣谕祂的圣言，便是从这些人的眼底，真神向大地展露笑颜。

It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;

因求而施，足称善举，因体谅而施，不待他人求恳，方为善中之善；

And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.

于慷慨之人而言，寻觅应得施与之人，喜悦有甚于施与本身。

And is there aught you would withhold?

你是否希冀，将些许家当留在手里？

All you have shall some day be given;

终有一日，你所有的一切皆须施与；

Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.

既是如此，现在就施与吧，自己把握施与的时节，别留待你的子裔。

You often say,"I would give, but only to the deserving."

你时常说：“我愿施与，但我只给应得之人。”

The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture. 

你果园里的树木不这么说，你牧场里的畜群不这么讲。

They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.

它们施与是为了生存，因为悭吝便是灭亡。

Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you.

他人既然有份获得世间的白昼与黑夜，自然有份，从你那里获得其余一切。

And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.

他人既然有份在生命的大洋之中饮水，自然有份，借你的小小溪流，灌满自己的空杯。

And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?

接受施与，意味着勇气和信任，甚至意味着慈悲，还有哪种权利，大得过因接受而来的权利？

And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see
