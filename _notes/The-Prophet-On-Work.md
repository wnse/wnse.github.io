On Work

Then a ploughman said , Speak to us of Work.

听闻此言，一名农夫开口说道，请给我们讲讲工作。

And he answered, saying:

于是他答道：

You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.

你们必须工作，方可跟上大地的脚步，跟上大地灵魂的脚步。

For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life's procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.

无所事事，便会成为疏离四季的异客，便会退出生命的队列。生命的队列盛大庄严，怀着自豪的谦恭，浩浩荡荡走向无穷。

When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.

工作之时，你便是一支长笛，时日的低语从你心间流过，变成旋律。

Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?

万物都在齐声歌吟，你们之中，可会有人情愿，充当暗哑无声的芦杆？

Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.

你们总是听人说，工作等于霉运，劳动便是不幸。

But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth's furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born,

而我告诉你们，工作之时，你们是在依照各自分担的使命，协力完成大地最高远的梦想，这份使命，在梦想初生之时，便已派给你们，

And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, 

劳作不息，其实是热爱生命，

And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life's inmost secret.

借劳作来热爱生命，便可体悟生命本真。

But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of youur brow shall wash away that which is written.

若是你苦痛不堪，将人生称作磨难，将生计称作写在额上的诅咒，那我要告诉你，只有你额上的汗滴，才能洗去写在那里的东西。

You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.

你们曾听人言，生命只是黑暗，心生厌倦的你们，附和了厌世者的意见。

And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge,

而我告诉你们，生命确然黑暗，除非有所追求，

And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,

追求皆属盲目，除非拥有知识，

And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,

知识皆属徒然，除非工作不殆，

And all work is empty save when there is love;

工作皆属空虚， 除非心中有爱；

And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God.

你们若是怀着热爱工作，便可把握自身，连结彼此，与真神时刻不离。

And what is it to work with love?

如何才是，怀着热爱工作？

It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.

是从心里抽出丝线来纺织布帛，一如布帛会是你亲人的穿着。

It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.

是用满怀的深情建造房屋，一如房屋会是你亲人的居所。

It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, evenn as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.

是温柔地播种，欢欣地收获，一如果实会是你亲人的食物。

It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,

是将你心灵的气息，注入你的每一件制作，

Ann to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.

心中知晓，所有那些蒙福的逝者，都站在你的周遭，观看你的工作。

Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep,"he who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is a nobler than he who ploughs the soil.

我时常听见你们，梦呓一般地说道，“雕琢大理石的人，从大理石当中觅得自身灵魂的形象，这样的人，比犁地的人高贵。

And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet."

捕捉虹彩的人，用虹彩在布帛上绘画人物，这样的人，比为我们的双脚制作凉鞋的人杰出。”

But I say, not in sleep but in the over-wakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass;

And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.

Work is love made visible.

And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.

For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger.

And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in the wine.

And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.
